# Flight-path-reconstruction-state-and-fault-prediction-model
This project focused on the computerâ€™s ability to reconstruct, predict and understand the flight path and state of a drone using biased, incomplete and unclean sensor data.  End result was to achieve the automatic prediction of the cause of a drone accident.
